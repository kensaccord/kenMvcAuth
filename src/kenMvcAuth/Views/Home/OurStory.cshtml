    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p id="ourStorys">
        Kendrick and KeShia first met in September of 2011 at the Addison Improv for a mutual friend’s birthday celebration. Laughs, food, and fun filled the evening, but at the end of the night, we all went our separate ways.  It wasn’t until years later that our paths would cross again, for good.
        <br/>
        <br />
        Facebook and Gateway Church deserve at least some of the credit for this union.  KeShia had just moved and while looking for a new church, decided to give Gateway Church a try since her coworker had raved about it so much.  She recalled Kendrick “checking in” at Gateway on Facebook, and reached out to get his opinion.  It went something like…
        <br />
        “Hey Kendrick! How are you? I noticed you check in at Gateway often. What do you think about it?”
        <br/>
        <br />
        “I love it, it’s a great church…..  You going to check it out this weekend? If you want someone to go with let me know.” …..
        <br/>
        <br />
        That is just what happened. We went to church and then The Cheesecake Factory.
        <br/>
        <br />
        To say the rest was bliss would be a bit, well, like lying.  Kendrick was strong in his pursuit, making his intentions known early on and KeShia was just the opposite; trying to not be pursued!  From several home repairs/projects, a few burnt meals by her, and spectacular meals by him, and last but not least, attending Gateway together on most weekends, a great friendship developed. After what seemed like forever, only four months, Kendrick introduced KeShia as his girlfriend during Christmas and she obliged.

        Our story is an interesting one. If anything, it shows us how rewarding it is to be patient and wait on GOD’s timing. His plans are so much greater than anything we could ever think of or imagine. We both feel extremely lucky to have found such a loving, caring, and loyal partner to share our lives with, and anxiously await each new day we spend together as husband and wife.

        Boo-hoo’d like a baby while listening to this on my way to work this morning. GRACE.
        Almost a year ago, I fb’d Ken to ask him about a church that my coworker raved about
        (thanks Mark!) that I recalled Ken “checking into” (even though I barely knew him….we
        had met at a comedy club 4/5 years prior for a friends bday (thanks Arlenea! Thanks
        Tice Owens!) Grey and I had just moved out after living with family during my pregnancy
        and most of his first year. (thanks Linsey Babitzke Simmons) and I really wanted to
        find a church home. Me- I see you check in at Gateway….how do you like it? Ken- I love
        it..;If you need someone to go with… FIRST “DATE” was to church at Gateway Church and
        then dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. PATIENCE. It really IS a virtue and he must be
        a monk. smile emoticon Resistant isn’t the word. Past disappointments had me jaded
        and dating was the LAST thing on my mind; my only focus was to be a good mom, work,
        and that was about it. RESILIANT. Ken was patient, consistent, and a really great
        friend and after 4/5 months, I agreed to be his girlfriend. He adores me. He loves
        my son. He loves God. Fast forward to now... GRATEFUL. Not what I deserved. GRACE
        ‪#‎foriknowtheplansihaveforyou‬ ‪#‎jeremiah2911‬ I love you Kendrick!

    <h2>Kendrick's Story</h2>
    <article id="kenStory">
            I must admit that I was feeling lost.  When you start looking around and all of
            your friends are getting married, it makes you think.  I had failed in my last
            relationship and was wondering if I would ever find someone.   That’s when I
            turned to God.  I started going to church every weekend.  I would check into
            church on my facebook app.  I prayed to God, I asked him for help.  I asked God
            to send someone special into my life.
            <br />

            One Thursday night, I’m hanging out at Dave and Busters with one of my best
            friends having a beer.  We are just talking about life, and that Thursday,
            September 4, 2014 at 9:59 pm, I get this message on facebook. “Hey Kendrick,
            how are you.”   I respond, “I’m good, what’s up.”  The next message is, “I
            noticed you check in at Gateway often.  My coworker has been mentioning how
            great it is and now that I’m in the area I was going to check it out.  What
            do you think about it?”  I went on about how much I loved and enjoyed the
            church.
            <br />

            And that is when this journey begins in my eyes; however, I can see that God
            had planted this seed long before I even knew it.  My good friends, Tice and
            Arlenea, invited me to join them on an outing for Arlenea’s birthday in 2011.
            I guess they were playing match maker, because that is when I met Ms. KeShia
            Simmons.  We all had a fun night and enjoyed the outing.  KeShia and I
            exchanged numbers. However, other than a few phone conversations and becoming
            friends on facebook, we each went on to living our separate lives.
            <br />

            So it was a shocking surprise to see a message from this young lady three
            years later.  I must say, it is one of the best surprises in my life.  God
            answered my prayer, and gave me the most precious gift a man can have, a wife.   I LOVE you KeShia Simmons.

            <br/>
            Thanks God.
